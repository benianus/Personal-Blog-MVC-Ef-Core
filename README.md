<h1>Personal Blog</h1>

I build a personal blog where you can write and publish articles. The blog will have two sections: a guest section and an admin section.

<p><b>Guest Section</b> — A list of pages that can be accessed by anyone:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Home Page:</b> This page will display the list of articles published on the blog.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article Page: This page will display the content of the article along with the date of publication.</p> 
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Admin Section</b> — are the pages that only you can access to publish, edit, or delete articles.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Dashboard:</b> This page will display the list of articles published on the blog along with the option to add a new article, edit an existing article, or delete an article.</li>
  <li><b>Add Article Page:</b> This page will contain a form to add a new article. The form will have fields like title, content, and date of publication.</li>
  <li><b>Edit Article Page:</b> This page will contain a form to edit an existing article. The form will have fields like title, content, and date of publication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the mockups to give you an idea of the different pages of the blog.</p>
